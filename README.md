# Scaffold-Eth 2 NFT Mint App

‚ö†Ô∏è Hello everyone, we are two university graduates from China, and it is a great pleasure to participate in this hackathon.

We built a simple NFT Mint App using SE2H, which includes:

1. Free casting, whitelist casting and public casting;
2. The owner of the contract can set the start and end time of casting;
3. The owner of the contract can change the state of whether casting is allowed at any time to avoid special circumstances;
4. When the NFT is completely minted, the owner of the contract can change the URL of the NFT to prevent users from knowing the rarity of the NFT in advance;
5. The owner of the contract can set the Merkle Tree Root of the whitelist casting list and the free casting list. Here we use the Merkle Tree to verify whether the user is a member of the list, so as to save some gas costs.

Due to our lack of time and insufficient preparation, the content display and function realization are not perfect, please forgive me, we will continue to improve and continue to build!
